                In our first class, we judged websites on many different factors. 
                One of which being the ability for it to translate to a mobile device. Although this seems like it should be a simple thing to accomplish, it is more complicated than it seems. Currently, 56% of all website traffic is through mobile devices and companies like Google have rethought their web development strategies. They switched to “mobile first indexing”, which is the process of developing a web page for a mobile device first and then refactoring it for a desktop. This is different then the original approach that involved creating a website for a desktop and then refactoring it for a mobile device.
