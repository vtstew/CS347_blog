        <h1>Why Do We Use Web Animations?</h1>
        <p>
          This week I read about the purpose of web animations. Mainly, they are used to attract users and improve 
          a website's usability. Accoring to one artical, there are five main reasons that a buisness would want to include 
          anaimations in their websites design: 
        </p>
        <div class="para">
            <h3>Attracting Attention</h3>
            <p>People want to be entertained. Animations make using a website more interesting, thus drawing the users
                attentions and attracting more users.
            </p>
            <h3>Guiding Users Through a Process</h3>
            <p>Animations can tell the user where they should be going/looking next as they navigate the website.</p>
            <h3>Engaging the User</h3>
            <p>Animations can tell a story that keeps users engaged for longer.</p>
            <h3>Communicating An Action</h3>
            <p>Animations help with instructions that a user may need to follow. It can make it easier for a user to understand
                and follow the directions.
            </p>
            <h3>Cleaning Up A Layout</h3>
            <p>Animations can either display or remove elements that are not always necessary to be on the page.</p>
            <h3>Example Animation</h3>
            <p>The following animation displays the code that is used to rotate the images around an axis. 
                If you hover over an image it will stop and zoom-in. An animation such as this one 
                could attract a users attention.
