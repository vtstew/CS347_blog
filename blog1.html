                In our first class, we judged websites on many different factors.
                One of which being the ability for it to translate to a mobile device.
                Although this seems like it should be a simple thing to accomplish, it is more complicated than it seems.
                Currently, 56% of all website traffic is through mobile devices and companies like Google have rethought their web development strategies.
                They switched to <q>mobile first indexing</q>, which is the process of developing a web page for a mobile device first and then refactoring it for a desktop.
                This is different then the original approach that involved creating a website for a desktop and then refactoring it for a mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>Mobile first indexing</q> emphasizes a well designed layout for people on mobile devices which is important because a bad website discourages users and makes them less likely to recommend the business as a whole. 
                Since the majority of users use mobile, businesses must pay extra attention to their mobile page. 
                88% of users that visit a business website on their phone either call or visit the business within 24 hours. 
                Because of this some sources are saying that <q>mobile is one of the <q>front doors</q> to a physical business.</q>
