        <h1>CS347 in the Spring</h1>
        <p>
            If I were to teach cs347 in the spring I would spend more time on JavaScript
            and less time on html and CSS. I feel like I would have understood JavaScript
            if it had been slowly introduced earlier on. 
            To help the students learn this subject better I would have them spend more time on blog posts that have to do with JavaScript
            so, they could get experience on their own.
            I would continue to walk through JavaScript code and explain how each section works
            because this was very helpful to me this last semester.

        <p>
            Something that would have helped me a lot would be having more resource that are relevant
            to the course. The textbook that we had was very helpful but sometimes it would
            be nice to see more than one example so that I can understand it better. A lot of the things
            I could find online but there were some things that I could not find, which made them very difficult to
            fully understand. I also would have liked to learn more about configuration because this was confusing at times.
            A more detailed walk through of that would be nice.
